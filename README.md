This work is based on a couple of answers I found on askubuntu and archforums(will add later). I am not an expert in shell script and hence there may be some unessecary code. Any corrections is gladly welcome for an efficent implementation.
The two shell scripts does the same thing, one uses ACPI which works on Ubuntu Mate and other uses uname which works on Solus.
You can run the scripts automatically by either using cron or just adding to autostart. The ACPI one may need editing to work in intervals.
