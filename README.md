Battery Level Notifier when Linux fails to.

This work is based on a couple of answers I found on askubuntu and archforums(will add later). 

I am not an expert in shell script and hence there may be some unessecary code. Any corrections is gladly welcome for an efficent implementation.

The two shell scripts does the same thing, one uses ACPI and other uses uname you can try which one works for you.

You can run the scripts automatically by either using cron or just adding to autostart. The ACPI one may need editing to work in intervals.
